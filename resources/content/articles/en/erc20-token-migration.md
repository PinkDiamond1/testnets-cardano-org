You will see your available balance and your Cardano address configured earlier. Please ensure you fill in the amount details. The amount for conversion cannot be less than zero or higher than the available balance. 

2. Click ‘Convert’, then confirm the transaction in Metamask. You will be then notified about successful or unsuccessful conversion.
3. When the transaction is processed on Ethereum, you will see the notification that your funds have been converted from Ethereum. When the transaction is processed on Cardano, you will receive a notification with your new total balance.

Note that the total amount of converted tokens is reflected on each token card on the Dashboard or Convert pages:
