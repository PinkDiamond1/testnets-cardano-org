### What is the Faucet?

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ADA to users of the testnet. While these tokens have no ‘real world’ value, they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ADA on the mainnet.

#### To request tokens using the faucet:

1. Enter the address of the account where you want to top up funds.
1. If you have been issued with an API key, please enter this to access any additional funds you may have been allocated
1. Click **Request**.
1. Funds should be in the testnet account you specified within a few minutes

##### Please note:

- Funds are in tAda (test ADA) only
- Make sure your address is for a payment address on the Alonzo Testnet:

- This is a limited-capability faucet (no wallet support yet, restricted funds, no native token support)
- Please do not request more funds than you actually require for your own use

_In addition, please update the return address listed underneath the form to:_
