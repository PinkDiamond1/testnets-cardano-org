## Support and help

Your feedback is important because it helps us improve the ERC20 converter testnet. To contact IOHK Technical Support, please [submit a request](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) using the Submit a request form.

You can also open Menu (...) in the ERC20 converter (on the main menu) and navigate to the ‘Support’ button, which will open the support page.
