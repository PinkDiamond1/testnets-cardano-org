## Overview

The Cardano testnet gives stake pool operators and smart contract developers the opportunity to actively test core Cardano functionality prior to deploying on mainnet. This includes stake pool operation, native tokens, metadata, smart contract testing, and DeFi cost estimation. 

 With the Cardano testnet now successfully upgraded to Alonzo/Goguen capability, weâ€™ll continue to add additional content here as the ecosystem develops. So, do give us your feedback in the [Alonzo testnet repo](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Alonzo-testnet) and offer your suggestions about improvements or enhancements you would like to see in future and help us deliver a best-in-class experience on the Cardano mainnet.
