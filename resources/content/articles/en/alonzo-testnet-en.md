## Alonzo

Smart contracts come to Cardano.

The ‘Alonzo’ hard fork will bring highly-anticipated new capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow for the implementation of smart contracts in Cardano, enabling the deployment of a wide range of new DeFi applications for the very first time.

We have progressed successfully through the first two alpha testnets, Alonzo Blue and Alonzo White, both supported initially by a small group of SPOs, partners, and Plutus Pioneers. We have now moved into the Alonzo Purple public testnet stage where we have expanded our audience again to bring in many more users at this stage. The next stage will be to hardfork the main Cardano testnet to the Alonzo era, prior to mainnet deployment and smart contract capability in September.

Over the next few weeks, we will continue to expand the program to include even more users as we integrate new testnet functionality and features on the way to mainnet deployment.

We are developing documentation and user guides and will publish these soon. For the latest fortnightly updates on the Alonzo rollout plan, please subscribe to [IOHK’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w).
