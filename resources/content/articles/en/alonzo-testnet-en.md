## Alonzo

The ‘Alonzo’ hard fork will bring exciting and highly-anticipated new capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow for the implementation of smart contracts in Cardano, enabling the deployment of a wide range of new DeFi applications for the first time. 

We have recently launched the first alpha testnet, Alonzo Blue, supported initially by a small group of SPOs, partners and Plutus Pioneers. This early group has now set up the network and following the release of the AlonzoBlue 2.0 node, are successfully running the very first smart contract scripts on Cardano.

Over the next few months, the program will expand to include more users as we integrate new testnet functionality and features on the way to mainnet deployment.

We are developing documentation and user guides and will publish these soon. For the latest fortnightly updates on the Alonzo rollout plan, please subscribe to [IOHK’s YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJ0p9aCW-W82TwNM-z3V2w) channel.
