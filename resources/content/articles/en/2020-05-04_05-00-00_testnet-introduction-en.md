## Cardano testnet introduction

The rollout of Alonzo sees the release of the fourth iteration of the testnet. A new version of the Daedalus wallet has also been written to be used specifically with this iteration of the testnet.

The testnet is designed to prove the new Alonzo smart contracts feature in a controlled environment. The experience, data, and feedback gathered so far during the rollout has contributed directly to the mainnet release of Alonzo.

### Getting involved

To maximize the value of this testnet, all you have to do is get involved. Running a node, delegating stake, or setting up and maintaining a stake pool - all of these activities will test the network and add to the quality of the final Alonzo implementation. Most importantly, whatever your experience with the testnet, we want your feedback. Let us know about bugs, usability issues, and potential improvements by raising an issue in the [Alonzo testnet GitHub repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/Alonzo-testnet).

This community-driven feedback is invaluable and will ensure that the mainnet Alonzo era is the best it can be. We will also be highlighting the best community-created resources and information about the testnet on our community content page.
