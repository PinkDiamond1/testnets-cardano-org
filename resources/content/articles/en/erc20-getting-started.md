> Note: the current ERC20 converter is the testnet version and there are some known issues that we are working on to be improved in gradual upgrades. 

To start using the ERC20 converter, you first need to go through the initial setup and registration.

### Setting up your Metamask account

1. To set up your Metamask account, you need to add an existing wallet or [download a new Metamask wallet extension](https://metamask.io/download.html) for your Chrome or Firefox browser.
2. Click Metamask on the toolbar and select ‘Get Started’.
3. Import your existing Ethereum wallet by using a 12-word seed phrase, or select ‘Create a Wallet’ if you do not have one. Agree with the terms and conditions to proceed.

4. Set up a new password, read the terms of use, then click ‘Create’. Note that it is important to write down your secret backup phrase as it is the only way that you can restore your account. Then click ‘All Done’ to proceed.
5. Now that the wallet account has been created, click the Metamask extension on the toolbar and ensure to select ‘Kovan Test Network’:
