## Getting Started

To help you get started we have written a set of tutorials:

- [Compiling and testing a Plutus App in the Plutus Playground](https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/plutus-playground.html)
- [Writing a basic Plutus app in the Plutus Playground](https://plutus-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plutus/tutorials/basic-apps.html#writing-a-basic-plutus-app-in-the-plutus-playground)

**Plutus Beta Playground**

If you have used a previous version of the Plutus Playground (prior to January 2021), you may find that any saved contracts you created will no longer work. This is because formats and APIs have been updated and simulations from the beta playground are not supported.

The recommended solution in this scenario is to load your gist in the new playground, fix the compilation errors, recreate the simulations and save it as a new gist.
