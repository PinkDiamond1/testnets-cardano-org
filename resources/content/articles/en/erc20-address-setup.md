To start converting or minting tokens in the ERC20 converter, you should be connected to your Metamask account to configure your receiving Cardano address.

1. In the converter, click ‘Connect’ ‒ on the top-bar menu, for example. 
2. You will see a window with possible options to connect your wallet. Click ‘Connect’ under the Metamask option:

3. The Metamask extension will open automatically. You can connect your wallet by clicking ‘Next’, then ‘Connect’. If your wallet was already connected to Metamask, you will only have to enter your password.
4. You can now configure your Cardano address:

5. Paste your Cardano address, this is the **Daedalus Testnet address**. Then click ‘Save’.
6. You can configure your wallets whenever you want by clicking ‘Menu’ (...), then ‘Configure your wallet’. You can also disconnect your wallet if needed.

> **Important**
> 
> Please keep in mind that you should always use the Kovan Test Network.
> 
> If you are connected to a wrong network (for example, Ropsten) on Meteamask, you will see the warning message: 
> *‘You are in the wrong network. Switch to Kovan.’*
> After switching the network, you will have to reload the web page.
> 
> If the connection modal is closed without a configured Cardano address, you will see a warning message below the top bar, inviting you to set up your Cardano wallet:
> *‘You need to set up your Cardano wallet. [Click here].’*
