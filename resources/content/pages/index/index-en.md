    # Develop with Cardano

    _Cardano is a third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform and home to the ada cryptocurrency. The Cardano testnet sits at the vanguard of the network's development. It provides a sandboxed environment for continuing innovation, harnessing the power of our community to iterate and improve._

    The Cardano testnet offers full Shelley functionality, including stake pools, stake delegation, and decentralization. It also integrates early Goguen functionality (e.g. transaction metadata) to enable a new era of utility, Dapps and smart contracts on Cardano. The testnet is open to any stake pool operator, developer or commercial partner who wishes to join us building the future.
    
    Visit [Cardano Documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/en/latest/#) to read documentation that supports features that are live on Cardano mainnet.
