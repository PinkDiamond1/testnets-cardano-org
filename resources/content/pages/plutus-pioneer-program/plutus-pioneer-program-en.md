    # Plutus Pioneer Program

    Plutus is Haskell and uses some advanced Haskell features like Template Haskell, type-level programming and effect systems. We will try to explain the needed concepts during the course, but some prior exposure to Haskell or at least functional programming would be very helpful.

    Programming experience and a general aptitude for logical/mathematical thinking are highly desirable.
