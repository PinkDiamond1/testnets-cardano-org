    # Plutus Pioneer Program

    Join our new training program and become a certified pioneer for Plutus! 

    We are now launching our Plutus pioneer program. We are looking for developers to join us on a learning journey and then help us stress test our code before we officially release Plutus to the world!

    ### Starts April 5th

    What is the Plutus pioneer program?
    -----------------------------------

    It is a program to recruit and train developers in Plutus for the Cardano ecosystem. When you join this program you will become part of a group that will have early access to a set of courses that teach you the core principles of how to code in both Haskell and Plutus. It will be highly interactive, with weekly videos, exercises, and Q&A sessions, along with exclusive access to the creators and key experts in the language. You will also be able to join a dedicated community channel, created to help pioneers connect to each other as you learn. 

    What prior experience do I need?
    --------------------------------

    This course is not for coding beginners. While you do not need to be an expert in formal methods, programming  experience and a general aptitude for logical and mathematical thinking are highly desirable. Some prior knowledge of Haskell or functional programming is also recommended, as Plutus is heavily based on Haskell and includes advanced features like Template Haskell, type-level programming, and effect systems. We recommend that you read the [Learn You a Haskell guide](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) before the course.

    Please register your interest using the form below and we shall get back to you.

    What can I expect to learn?
    ---------------------------

    This course will cover the building blocks of Haskell and Plutus, including functions and data types, type classes, monads, template Haskell, using the Plutus Playground, the extended UTxO model, working with Plutus on and off the chain, minting policies, state machines, the Plutus application framework, as well as some case studies and practical exercises. 

    When does it start?
    -------------------

    It is a ten week programme that will start on April 5th and run through to June 11th. It will involve approximately ten hours a week of your time and efforts. As with all learning experiences, the more you put in the more you will get out!

    How can I register for the Plutus pioneer program?
    --------------------------------------------------

    If you are interested in joining our program please complete the registration form below and we will be in touch soon.

    Will I be certified?
    --------------------

    Yes, we will be awarding certificates to those pioneers that complete the entire program and are successful. Certificates will be represented as non fungible tokens (on the testnet) and locked by a Plutus contract. Pioneers can demonstrate their qualification by constructing an appropriate transaction to unlock their individual token.
